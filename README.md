# A Google Client-Side Encryption API implementation.


## Architecture

KACLS relies on AWS configured using an active-active multi-region serverless architecture, specifically the ALB -> Lambda Target serverless pattern for lowest processing latencies. Encryption is done using KMS with the newer Multi-Region key replicas. Storage via DynamoDb multi-region Global Tables. All infrastructure is defined via AWS CDK v2 Infrastructure as Code.

Only cross regional dependencies are SSM paramaters stored in us-east-1 for communicating DNS Hosted Zone information, and KMS Primary Key information. A us-east-1 outage would prevent deployments during the outage, but not disrupt the service from running fully in other regions.

Aside from the SSM paramaters used to shuttle `us-east-1` ARN values out to other regions, all resources are deployed within their own region, and dependencies should be constrained to the region, in the event a region is unavailable, available regions should continue operations, with impacted traffic getting sent to available regions via Route53's latency routing policy.

This might make some resources redundant, namely ACM Certificates or WAF WebACLs, but it offers a clean separation of resource dependencies, in the event of an outage, at the expense of greater operational cost.

There are probably many ways to improve the CDK deployment described below, but I wanted the ability to control how stacks were deployed in each region, so most stacks that depend on other stacks, do so via CFN export/import, rather than passing TS values. From my experience this loose coupling means more orchestrating at deployment time, but provides better flexibility to make changes later.



## Deploy

Generally  deployments should go out to `us-east-1` first, given AWS' dependency on some components being deployed to `us-east-1` first, namely as Route53 Hosted Zone and KMS' Primary Keys. 



### DNS

Deploy the DNS zone in `us-east-1`

```
cdk deploy KaclsDomainUsEast1Stack
```

After completing open the AWS web console and navigate to the zone in AWS Route 53, locate 4 NS records and add them to your DNS registrar's list of nameservers for your domain name. THis might take a while to propagate through the internet.

Then deploy to `us-west-2`, depends on `KaclsDomainUsEast1Stack`.
This does not deploy any DNS resources, but does make the hostedZoneID, the hostedZoneARN, and zoneName available in the region as CloudFormation exports

```
cdk deploy KaclsDomainUsWest2Stack
```


### ACM

Deploy the TLS Certs to ACM. First to `us-east-1`

```
cdk deploy KaclsCertUsEast1Stack
```

And again to `us-west-2`, as we want the regions to be as independent as possible.

```
cdk deploy KaclsCertUsWest2Stack
```


### KMS

Deploy the primary encryption key to `us-east-1`

```
cdk deploy KaclsEncKeyUsEast1Stack
```

And then a key replica to `us-west-2`

```
cdk deploy KaclsEncKeyUsWest2Stack
```


### VPC

Deploy the VPC needed by the ALB, fist in `us-east-1`

```
cdk deploy KaclsVpcUsEast1Stack
```

Deploy to `us-west-2`

```
cdk deploy KaclsVpcUsWest2Stack
```

### WAF

Deploy the WebACL for the WAF to `us-east-1`

```
cdk deploy KaclsWafUsEast1Stack
```

And then again to `us-west-2`

```
cdk deploy KaclsWafUsWes2Stack
```

### ALB 

Deploy the Application Load Balancer (ALBv2) to `us-east-1`

```
cdk deploy KaclsAlbUsEast1Stack
```

And then again to `us-west-2`

```
cdk deploy KaclsAlbUsWest2Stack
```


### API

Finally, deploy the API to `us-east-1`

```
cdk deploy KaclsApiUsEast1Stack
```

And then again to `us-west-2`

```
cdk deploy KaclsApiUsWest2Stack
```
